<p><strong>6. HOSTED AND SUBMITTED CONTENT - GENERALLY</strong><br />At times, we may host third party articles and other content on our Site, or articles or content written or posted by our own employees and contractors (collected &ldquo;Hosted Content&rdquo;). All of such Hosted Content available on or through the Services and/or the Site is owned by us, our suppliers, and our contributors, and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other proprietary rights. We give you permission to use the Hosted Content for personal, non-commercial purposes only. You may print, download, and store articles and other information included within the Hosted Content for your own convenience, but you may not distribute, republish, sell, mine, exploit, frame or scrape any of the Hosted Content, or exploit the Hosted Content for commercial gain.<br />At times, you may be invited to submit content to the Site, which may include but is not necessarily limited to items such as documents, music, sound, photographs, video, topical questions or responses submitted through forums or blog entries, either for publication, circulation and/or distribution (collectively, the &ldquo;Submitted Content&rdquo; and when used generically with Hosted Content, &ldquo;Content&rdquo;)). Such Submitted Content is yours and ReStyleSource does not claim ownership of Submitted Content, but by submitting such Submitted Content you grant ReStyleSource a nonexclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide license to link to, reproduce, distribute, adapt, promote, display, and sublicense the Submitted Content. We reserve the right to remove any Submitted Content at any time for any reason without notice. Further, any publication of any Submitted Content is at our sole and absolute discretion.<br />By providing Submitted Content, you certify that you own the Submitted Content, or otherwise have the right to freely redistribute the Submitted Content without limitation, and that providing this Submitted Content will not violate or infringe upon the rights of any third party, including but not limited to, copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, rights of publicity or other proprietary rights.

<p><strong>7. HOSTED AND SUBMITTED CONTENT - COPYRIGHT AND OTHER RIGHTS</strong><br />ReStyleSource assumes no liability with respect to disputes over Content ownership, copyright, or trademarks. In the event that we are notified that your Submitted Content allegedly infringes the ownership, copyright, trademark or other rights of a third party, we will follow the procedures set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&ldquo;DMCA&rdquo;) for taking down your Submitted Content and notifying you of the same. If you provide us with a counter-notice pursuant to the DMCA, we will follow the procedures outlined in the DMCA for addressing such counter-notice and potentially reposting your Submitted Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we retain the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to remove your Submitted Content or refuse to publish the same for reasons unrelated to Content ownership, copyright or trademark disputes, including maintaining our preferred commercial or artistic impression for the Site.<br />It is our policy to terminate the License of any users who are repeat infringers of others&rsquo; copyrights or trademarks.<br />If you believe that Content included on the Site is your proprietary work and has been copied in a way that constitutes an infringement of your rights in that work, please immediately notify ReStyleSource of any such infringement at mbalen@restylesource.com, in the manner set forth below. All reports and inquiries will be kept confidential, except to the extent necessary to investigate any alleged violation and enforce these Terms of Use. Pursuant to the requirements of the DMCA, ReStyleSource has designated the following agent to receive infringement notifications:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Michelle Balen</strong><br />Administrative Manager ReStyleSource.com<br />19 North Robson, Suite 101<br />Mesa, AZ 85201<br />Phone: 1-855-80STYLE (1-855-807-8953) Email: <a href="mailto:mbalen@restylesource.com">mbalen@restylesource.com</a></p>
<p>When reporting an infringement, please ensure you provide, in writing, all of the following information: (i) a detailed description of the Content on the Site that you, in good faith, believe is an infringement of your ownership rights, including information reasonably sufficient to permit ReSytleSource to locate the allegedly infringing Content; (ii) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use has not been authorized by you, the copyright owner, or by the law; (iii) a statement by you declaring under penalty of perjury that (A) all of the information you have provided is accurate, (B) that you are the owner of the copyright interest involved or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the actual owner, and (C) your physical address, telephone number, and email address. In addition, you must mail a copy of the foregoing information to ReStyleSource&rsquo;s agent at the address noted above with your physical signature affixed to the copy next to the statement indicating that you are the owner of the copyright interest involved or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the actual owner. ReStyleSource will remove the infringing posting(s), subject to the procedures outlined in the DMCA.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES/LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong><br />While we use reasonable efforts to include accurate and up-to-date information on the Site, we make no representations as to the accuracy, quality, timeliness, availability, or completeness of the information, documents, Content or other materials available on the Site, and you should not rely upon them. We provide the Site and any Service on an &ldquo;AS IS, AS AVAILABLE&rdquo; basis. You use the Site and Services at your own risk, and ReStyleSource, its employees, directors, and agents are not liable for any errors or omissions in the Site&rsquo;s or Service&rsquo;s content or delivery, or for any form of loss or damage (including any consequential, indirect, incidental, special, or exemplary damages, even if known to us) that may result from use of the Site or Services. We expressly disclaim all warranties, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement. If any of the above provisions are void under governing law, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>9. INDEMNIFICATION</strong><br />You will indemnify and hold ReStyleSource, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, and employees harmless against any claim, dispute, or demand, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, which may arise from a breach or violation by you of these Terms of Use, including any Content submitted to, uploaded to, or transmitted via ReStyleSource by you.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>10. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF</strong><br />Your breach of these Terms of Use may result in immediate and irreparable harm to us, for which there may be no adequate remedy at law, and, therefore, you agree that we shall be entitled to equitable relief to compel you to cease and desist all unauthorized use, evalu- ation and/or disclosure of information obtained through the Site, which is in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>11. JURISDICTION</strong><br />These Terms of Use, and the rights and obligations hereunder, are to be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Arizona. Any legal action or proceeding between you and us arising out of or relating to the Terms of Use or your use of the Site shall be brought exclusively in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction sitting in Phoenix, Arizona, and you hereby expressly and irrevocably consent to be bound by the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>12. NO WAIVER; SEVERABILITY</strong><br />A waiver of any breach of any provision of the Terms of Use shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any repetition of such breach and shall not in any manner affect any other terms or conditions of the Terms of Use. We do not waive any rights by the failure to enforce these Terms of Use in every instance in which they might apply. In the event that any provision of the Terms of Use is held to be unenforceable, it will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions and will be replaced by an enforceable provision that is the closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable provision.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>13. ASSIGNABILITY</strong><br />We may assign our rights and delegate our duties under the Terms of Use either in whole or in part at any time without notice. You may not assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer your rights or obligations, in whole or in part, under the Terms of Use to anyone else without our prior written consent.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>14. RELATIONSHIP</strong><br />This Agreement does not establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency between you and us.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>15. UPDATES AND CHANGES TO TERMS OF USE</strong><br />We may add to, change, update or modify these Terms of Use by posting such addition, change, update or modification on the Site. Any such change, update or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the Site.</p>
